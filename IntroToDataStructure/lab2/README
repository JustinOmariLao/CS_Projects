* names respectively, then classifies the characters on each line of the input file into the following categories:
* alphabetic characters (upper or lower case), numeric characters (digits 0-9), punctuation, and white space
* (space, tab, or newline). Any characters on a given line of the input file which cannot be placed into one of
* these four categories (such as control or non-printable characters) will be ignored. Your program will print a
* report to the output file for each line in the input file giving the number of characters of each type, and the
* characters themselves.
