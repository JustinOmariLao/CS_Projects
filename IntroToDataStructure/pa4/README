*               durations, determine (1) the total wait time (the total time spent by all 𝑚 jobs waiting in queues),
*               (2) the maximum wait time (the longest wait any of the 𝑚 jobs endured) and (3) the average wait time
*               over all 𝑚 jobs. Furthermore, determine these quantities for 𝑛 processors, where 𝑛 ranges from 1 to
*               𝑚 − 1
